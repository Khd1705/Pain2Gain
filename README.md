HackRU 2024 Project: Created an exercise tracking web app using computer vision

The PoseTrackingModule file contains the import code for importing the body tracking model from mediapipe and setting it up so its compatible with the computer's webcam.

The ExerciseTacker file contains the logic for how the different exercises (Push-ups, sit-ups, and squats) are identified, tracked, and incremented, as well as creating a localhost output using streamlit library.
